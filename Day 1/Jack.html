    <h1>About jack</h1>
    <p><h2>The name Jack is a derivative of John, which originated in medieval England. The name went from John to Johnkin to Jankin to Jackin to, you guessed it, Jack. There is also a theory that Jack is Celtic in origin, meaning "healthy, strong, and full of vital energy." <br>Interestingly, the name was so common in the Middle Ages that Jack became a generic term for a man. Think about the phrase "jack of all trades"—a person who can do many different types of work.</h2> </p>
